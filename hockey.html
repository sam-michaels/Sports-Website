            Ice hockey is the most popular sport of Canada and a big part of
            Canadian culture. There are many hockey leagues for all ages and all
            skill levels. Most of the leagues are recreational, but some are
            professional or semi-professional. One of the popular junior hockey
            leagues in Canada is the

            which mainly consists of teams within Ontario but also includes a
            few teams from nearby American cities. The most popular professional
            ice hockey league is the NHL (National Hockey League) which is the
            4th biggest sports league in North America after MLB (baseball), NBA
            (basketball), and NFL (football).

            The London Knights are a team in the OHL and their home arena is
            Budweiser Gardens, here in downtown London. The Knights always seem
            to have success in the OHL, as evident by their 4 OHL championships
            over the last 18 years and 2 Memorial Cup championships in the same
            period. In 2023, the Knights made it all the way to the final round
            of the OHL championships against the Peterborough Petes, but their
            main goaltender got injured which caused them to struggle and
            eventually lose the series.

              The NHL currently has 32 teams. 25 of the teams are based in the
              US and the other 7 are based in Canadian cities. The 7 Canadian
              teams are:

            </ul>
            <p>
              Although the majority of the NHL teams are based in American
              cities, about 40% of active NHL players are Canadian - and that
              number was even higher in previous years.

              The Toronto Maple Leafs (or just Leafs, for short) is one of the
              teams in the NHL with the largest fanbases, especially in Southern
              Ontario but also across Canada. The Leafs have won the prestigious
              Stanley Cup 13 times since their inception, but are often
              ridiculed because their last championship was back in 1967. In
              recent years, the Leafs have repeatedly done well during the
              regular season but struggled in the playoffs with first-round
              eliminations which many fans called a curse. In the 2023 playoffs,
              the Leafs broke that "curse" by winning their first round series,
              but then went on to lose in the second-round so the victory of
              progress was short lived.

              Some hockey fans in the London area cheer for Detroit Red Wings
              given the proximity to Detroit. Despite being in the US, Detroit
              is roughly the same distance from London as Toronto is! Some fans
              also cheer for other nearby American teams like the Buffalo
              Sabres, Boston Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins, or Chicago Blackhawks.
