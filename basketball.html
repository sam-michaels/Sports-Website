            Basketball is one of the most popular sports in North America. It
            was invented by a Canadian physical education teacher in 1891.
            Basketball was conceived as a safe sport compared to the more
            physical sports like football. Basketball is also one of the cheaper
            sports to play as players don't need the expensive equipment that is
            required for many other sports.

              The NBLC (National Basketball League of Canada) is a small league
              with just 4 teams, all of which are in Ontario and 3 of which are
              in Southern Ontario. The local team, London Lightning, is based
              here in London and play at the Budweiser Gardens - the same arena
              in which the Knights hockey team plays.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lightning have won the NBLC championship both in 2022 and 2023
              and now have 6 championships in total!

              The Toronto Raptors are the only Canadian basketball teams in the
              NBA (National Basketball Association) and they play in Scotiabank
              Arena - the same arena in which the Maple Leafs hockey team plays.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also similar to the Leafs, the Raptors struggled in the playoffs
              even in years when they did very well during the regular season.
              They were eliminated in first or second round on several occasions
              in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, in 2019, things were different for the Raptors. They
              progressed through the different series all the way to the final
              round, which was against the extremely talented Golden State
              Warriors. Although they were up against a challenging team with
              experience winning such championships, the Raptors managed to win
              that series to achieve their first ever championship. Kyle Lowry
              and Kawhi Leonard were arguably the two most important players on
              the team that year that led them to the championship.
              Unfortunately, Leonard left the team soon after and they have gone
              into rebuilding mode.
