            America. Although baseball is considered one of the most popular
            sports even in Canada, there are very few professional players who
            come from Canada. The vast majority come from the US and Central and
            South America. However, Canada does have many minor leagues with
            local players.

              The Toronto Blue Jays are the only MLB (Major League Baseball)
              team based in a Canadian city. The Blue Jays play in Rogers Center
              (formerly called SkyDome) next to the CN Tower in downtown
              Toronto. The arena is well known for its convertible-like roof
              that is typically open for most home games, but closes for rainy
              games and when the arena isn't being used.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Blue Jays have made it to the World Series championships twice
              and won both times. They were in consecutive years in 1992 and
              1993. Since then, the Blue Jays haven't had much success in the
              post-season, usually not making it at all or getting eliminated
              early in the playoffs, much like their hockey counterpart, the
              Leafs.

                Buck played 17 seasons in the MLB starting in 1969 for Kansas
                City Royals until 1986 on the Blue Jays. After ending his
                playing career in Toronto, he was hired as the official
                announcer for the Blue Jays and still does that to this day at
                the age of 74!

                Roger was a well-respected baseball pitcher who played most of
                his career on American teams but also played in Toronto for two
                years. He put up impressive records and stats and won awards for
                his incredible pitching. After those two years, he asked to be
                traded away to a team that would be more successful in winning a
                championship, and he was: to the Yankees where he then won two
                consecutive championships.

                Roy was a pitcher on the Blue Jays for about 10 years starting
                in 1998 and then he played in Philadelphia for the last few
                years of his career. In 2017, a few years after he retired, Roy
                tragically died in a crash while flying his small plane near
                Florida.

              <li>
                Jose played on many different teams in the MLB, but spent the
                majority of his time on the Blue Jays, from 2008 to 2017. A
                memorable but controversial moment came in a 2015 post-season
                game in which Jose hit a big homerun which would win the game,
                and he threw his bat in the air while watching the home run.
                This act, which has been called the "bat flip", was appreciated
                by Jays fans but caused anger to the opposing team, the Texas
                Rangers.

                Vladdy has been a member of the Blue Jays since his MLB career
                began in 2019. Vladdy is known for hitting a lot of home runs
                and being an instrumental member of the team. Vladdy's dad, also
                named Vladimir Guerreo, was a Hall of Fame MLB player from 1996
                to 2011 who played on several teams but not the Blue Jays.

                comes from a family of baseball players. Bo's dad was also a
                Hall of Fame player and Bo's younger brother has also played in
                the MLB. Bo has been another key member of the Blue Jays in

                has been important in supporting the young Blue Jays roster.
